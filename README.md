Android Kotlin simple text notepad using Storage Access Framework

At some point this will be a functional simple text notepad.
I will be adding code from various other projects as I go
along.  It's written in Kotlin and I'm using it to learn
Kotlin and the GooglePlay process for android apps.  One of
the goals is to have an app that will work from API-19
through whatever is current (API-29 right now)

Initial commit to git hub.  Current code creates a shortcut
on the user's home screen if they want one.

Lots of changes.   Basic functionality is there I think.

App is based on StorageDemo source code discussed in 
the Kotlin edition of [Android Studio 3.5 Essentials]
(https://www.ebookfrenzy.com/ebookpages/kotlin_android_studio_35_ebook.html).
I've used several of this series and they've all been a good value.

At this point, the UI is funky but it's working well enough I've 
started to use it.

It uses Google's Storage Access Framework (SAF) and should work
through Android 10.
