# Notes
Android Kotlin simple text notepad

At some point this will be a functional simple text notepad.
I will be adding code from various other projects as I go
along.  It's written in Kotlin and I'm using it to learn
Kotlin and the GooglePlay process for android apps.  One of
the goals is to have an app that will work from API-19
through whatever is current (API-29 right now)

Initial commit to git hub.  Current code creates a shortcut
on the user's home screen if they want one.
